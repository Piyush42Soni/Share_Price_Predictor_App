# Stock_Market_Share_Price_Predictor_App
It is an Android App that predicts the value of IBM's share price after 1 hour of the current value using a deep learning model consisting of 2 layers of LSTM and 1 layer of CNN which is then converted into a TF lite model to make it compatible with mobile devices

I used API https://www.alphavantage.co/ for data collection to get the latest stock value and fetch it using Retrofit.
