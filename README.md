# Share_Price_Predictor_App
It is an Android App that predicts the value of IBM's share price after 1 hour of the current value using a deep learning model consisting of 2 layers of LSTM and 1 layer of CNN
which is then converted into a TF lite model to make it compatible with mobile devices

I had used API https://www.alphavantage.co/ for data collection and to get latest value of stock and featch it using Retrofit.
