# Stock Market Share Price Predictor App
## Description
It is an Android app that uses the TF lite model to forecast the future value of IBM's stock.
In my deep learning model, I used LSTM layers to predict the value of stocks, then converted the model into a TF-Lite model and sent it to my Android app.
I have used the alphavantage.co API to get the data for training.
